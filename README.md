# Jupyter Notebook Portfolio
A collection of Jupyter Notebooks focused on highlighting analytics and visualizations on various security projects.

* This project has five parts (**A-E**) and focuses on analyzing and driving meaningful analytics and visualizations from the public Cobalt Strike Hunting Dataset hosted on Google  Spreadsheet by [@MichalKoczwara](https://twitter.com/MichalKoczwara/) (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bYvBh6NkNYGstfQWnT5n7cSxdhjSn1mduX8cziWSGrw/edit#gid=516128248)
* The Google Spreadsheet documents valuable details on active Cobalt Strike servers, including their hosting IP address, User Agents, among other things. 
* For projects parts (**A-D**), the **"Cobalt Strike-Te-k research 2020"** was locally downloaded and processed through Jupyter Notebook. 
* Due to the large size of the dataset, a much smaller subset was used locally in parts (A-D) to increase performance and reduce processing time (cb_servers_small.csv - uploaded for reference).
* However, for the last part (**E**), the Jupyter Notebook was configured to read live data directly from the Google Spreadsheet's URL.
* The reason for several parts is because a side goal of this project was to document the entire process of using Jupyter Notebook so someone who is just getting started with Jupyter Notebook can find it helpful. 
* *If you are just interested in seeing only the final results of the Notebook, please download and run the last part (**[E](https://github.com/azeemnow/jupyter-notebook/blob/main/Jupyter_Notebook_Cobalt_Strike_Servers_1-E_updated.ipynb)**) in Jupyter.*
