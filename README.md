# Jupyter Notebook Portfolio
A collection of Jupyter Notebooks focused on highlighting analytics and visualizations on various security projects.


# [Project 1: Cobalt Strike Hunting Dataset](https://github.com) 
* This project has five parts (**A-E**) and focuses on analyzing and driving meaningful analytics and visualizations from the public Cobalt Strike Hunting Dataset hosted on Google  Spreadsheet by @MichalKoczwara (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bYvBh6NkNYGstfQWnT5n7cSxdhjSn1mduX8cziWSGrw/edit#gid=516128248)
* The Google Spreadsheet documents valuable details on active Cobalt Strike servers, including their hosting IP address, User Agents, among other things. 
* For parts (**A-D**), the "Cobalt Strike-Te-k research 2020" was locally downloaded and processed through Jupyter Notebook. However, for the last part (**E**), the Jupyter Notebook was configured to read live data directly from the Google Spreadsheet's URL.
